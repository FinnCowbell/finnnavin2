              <p>Music-lyric trivia meets Kahoot in our fast-paced, phone-based music guessing game! A computer connects to the Spotify API and calibrates streaming of music with the karaoke-style display. Clients connect to the host and take turns singing missing sections of well known songs into their microphones. They are scored on their accuracy. At the end of the game, a winner is determined. Our initial goal was to create an easy to use framework for phones to connect as controllers to a host machine (similar to Kahoot or JackBox Games). We decided the best way to create this framework was to develop a game. We created this project in 36 hours at HackUMass VII. Our team was honored to win 2nd Place, as well as Best Web App.

              <p>This project was my team’s first place submission to the Connecticut Technology Council’s College Tech Challenge. The objective was to create a website that offered resources to recovering Opioid users and their families in Connecticut. We were required to utilize data from data.ct.gov in a creative way. We utilized Bootstrap, node.js and the Google Maps API to create a webapp that gives the user access to local Drug Boxes, Care Facilities, and Pharmacies that carry Naloxone.

              <p>This project earned first place in it’s category the 2018 National Museum of Math Hackathon. The goal was to create visually appealing and fun mathematical representations for use in the museum. I programmed a digital representation of the beauty of orbiting bodies in our solar system (such as the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/visualizedmath/comments/805xyr/pentagram_of_venus/">Pentagram of Venus</a>). The program was made for an interactive touchscreen floor called the Math Floor. It is in the rotation of programs displayed on the floor.
